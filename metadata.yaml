description: Much Ado About Nothing is a romantic comedy by William Shakespeare set
  in Messina, Sicily about a pair of lovers named Claudio and Hero due to be married
  in a week. To pass the time before their wedding day they conspire with Don Pedro,
  the prince of Aragon, to trick their friends, Beatrice and Benedick, into confessing
  their love for one another. The prince's brother Don John, however, jealous of both
  Don Pedro's power and his affection for Claudio, conspires to sabotage the coming
  wedding. [Adapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Much_Ado_about_Nothing].
